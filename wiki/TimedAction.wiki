=Description=
`TimedAction` is created to help hide the mechanics of how to implement [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protothreads Protothreading] and general millis() timing. It is sutied for those actions that needs to happen approximately every x milliseconds.


=API=
==Constructors==
{{{
TimedAction(unsigned int interval, void (*function)())
}}}
Creates a `TimedAction` that triggers `function` every `interval` milliseconds.

{{{
TimedAction(unsigned long prev, unsigned int interval,void (*function)())
}}}
Creates a `TimedAction` that waits minimum `prev` milliseconds, then triggers `function` every `interval` milliseconds.

==Functions==
  * `void reset()` : Reset this `TimedAction`
  * `void disable()` : Disable this `TimedAction`
  * `void enable()` : Enable this `TimedAction`
  * `void check()` : Check to see if it's time to execute `function`
